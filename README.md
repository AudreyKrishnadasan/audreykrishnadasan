### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Hi all! My name is Audrey Krishnadasan and I use she/her pronouns. I am a student at Occidental College in Los Angeles, CA and graduate spring of 2025. I am a computer science major.

I am passionate about expanding my knowledge and learning new things. I like figuring things out for myself, over this winter break I taught myself Python! Then, I converted one of my biggest projects, Police Dispatch, from Java to Python. My next step in this project is to create a GUI for this project using Tkinter. I pride myself on being a quick learner and being flexible, I hope to bring and utilize these skills in any workplace environment I continue in.

As a woman of color in a STEM field, I understand the hardships and barriers we have to overcome to be successfull in this industry. I hope to defy these battles and to help create a more diverse industry and foster a more accepting workplace.

I am a Teaching Assistant for two classes here at Occidental, Data Structures and Advanced Programming, I am passionate about helping students understand the concepts behind implementations of data structues and helping them develop debugging strategies to build their confidence in coding. 

I am currently looking for a summer internship for 2023, hopefully to dive into the field. I am excited to work with others and collaborate on projects. I consider one of my strong suits to be communication, I hope to utilize this tool as I embark on new projects and work with my peers.

How to reach me:

Fun Fact: I am on the varsity softball team at Occidental! While it is sometimes tough balancing athletics and schoolwork, I enjoy being surrounded with a team and all working collaboratively towards a common goal.
