### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub profile! My name is Audrey Krishnadasan, and I'm currently a senior at the University of San Diego, pursing my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science. I have a passion for software engineering and am determined to make a significant impact in the tech world by contributing to and leading successful projects.


### Repositories

You'll find a couple different types of projects in my Repositories, including some of my leetcode challenge work! I have been trying to explore many different sides of the tech world so I can be well-versed in all subjects and truly find my passion/best skills!

### Future Endeavors

Looking ahead, I'm excited to enhance my coding skills through internships, workshops, and continued academic pursuits. I'm also interested in networking with like-minded individuals, mentors, and industry professionals to gain valuable insights and broaden my horizons.
