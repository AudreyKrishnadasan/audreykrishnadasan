### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Hi all! My name is Audrey Krishnadasan and I use she/her pronouns. I am a student at Occidental College in Los Angeles, CA and graduate spring of 2025. I am a computer science major. 

I am passionate about expanding my knowledge and learning new things. I am currently enrolled in an online SQL course to learn more about Data science. I pride myself on being a quick learner and being flexible, I hope to bring and utilize these skills in any workplace enviorment I continue in.

I am currently taking a Computer Organization class, I am learning C and MIPS assembly language in this class. I am learning how my machine stores memory and deals with data. This is incredibly interesting, it helps to make my code more efficient and to increase my understanding of what my code directly does in the computer.

I am a Teaching Assistant for two classes here at Occidental, Data Structures and Advanced Programming, I am passionate about helping students understand the concepts behind implementations of data structues and helping them develop debugging strategies to build their confidence in coding. I am currently working on creating video tutorials explaining the implementations of data structures such as LinkedLists, AVL Trees, Hashtables, and more! 

I am currently looking for a summer internship for 2023, hopefully to dive into the field. I am excited to work with others and collaborate on projects. I consider one of my strong suits to be communication, I hope to utilize this tool as I embark on new projects and work with my peers.

How to reach me:
    krishnadasan@oxy.edu
    
Fun Fact: I am on the varsity softball team at Occidental! While it is sometimes tough balancing athletics and schoolwork, I enjoy being surrounded with a team and all working collaboratively towards a common goal.
