### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub profile! My name is Audrey Krishnadasan, and I'm currently a junior at the University of San Diego, majoring in Computer Science. I have a passion for project management and am determined to make a significant impact in the tech world by leading and coordinating successful projects.

### Why Project Management?

Throughout my academic journey, I've been fascinated by the process of bringing ideas to life through teamwork, effective planning, and meticulous execution. As a natural organizer and problem solver, project management aligns perfectly with my skills and interests. I thrive on collaborating with diverse teams and turning complex challenges into achievable milestones.


### Repositories

You'll find a couple different types of projects in my Repositories, including some of my leetcode challenge work! I have been trying to explore many different sides of the tech world so I can be well-versed in all subjects and truly find my passion/best skills!

### Future Endeavors

Looking ahead, I'm excited to enhance my project management skills through internships, workshops, and continued academic pursuits. I'm also interested in networking with like-minded individuals, mentors, and industry professionals to gain valuable insights and broaden my horizons.
